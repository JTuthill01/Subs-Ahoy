# Subs-Ahoy
A very, very basic survive as long as you can side scroller type style game. Nothing to exciting. 


So very much credit to this game goes to Headturna and all he has taught me, and the SFML discord folks for putting up with all my questions. I hope to add animations of sorts down the road, but for now I am okay with how it stands right now.
